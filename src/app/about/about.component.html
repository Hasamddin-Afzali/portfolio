            <p>Hello there, I'm Hasamuddin Afzali, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer and Computer Engineer currently based in Karabuk, Turkey. Originally hailing from Afghanistan, I was born in 2000, and since then, my journey has been a pursuit of knowledge, technology, and creativity.</p>
            <p>My academic journey began at Karabuk University, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Programming. However, my thirst for knowledge and my fascination with the world of computers and programming led me to further specialize in Computer Engineering. I believe that continuous learning is the key to staying relevant in the fast-paced tech industry.</p>
            <p>As an ambitious individual with an eye for design, I am delighted to be a part of Birlik Ajans, an esteemed agency in Karabuk, Turkey, where I contribute as a skilled designer. I find immense joy in transforming ideas into visually captivating realities, and my work at the agency allows me to channel my creativity while solving real-world design challenges.</p>
            <p>Web development has become the centerpiece of my career. Being a Full Stack Web Developer allows me to bring my ideas to life from both front-end and back-end perspectives. I thrive in crafting intuitive and user-friendly websites and applications that leave a lasting impact on users. My dedication to excellence drives me to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the field, ensuring that my projects are always cutting-edge.</p>
